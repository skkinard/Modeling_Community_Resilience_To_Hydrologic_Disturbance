Variable,Description
q_max,maximum daily discharge during 4 weeks prior to sampling
q_min,minimum daily discharge during 4 weeks prior to sampling
q_base,annual median of daily discharge
F.Threshold,daily discharge exceeding 10*q_base
D.Threshold,More than 7 contiguous daily discharges below the annual 25th percentile of daily discharge
F.Magnitude,(q_max-q_base) / q_base
D.Magnitude,(q_min-q_base) / q_base
F.Duration,Contiguous days from the date of q_max to the first day under the F.Threshold
D.Duration,Contiguous days from the date of q_min to the first day over the 25th percentile of daily discharge
Rain.Month,Rain of the month prior to sampling
Rain.30yr,Annual average rainfall
Abundance,Log Response Ratio (LRR) of fish individuals per square meter
Biomass,LRR of fish mass per square meter
Sp.Richness,LRR of the number of unique species
SW.Index,LRR of Shannon-Weiner Index; measures fish species diversity and evenness
Centroid.Dist,LRR of the euclidean distance to the site centroied from constrained RDA; measures community compositional deviation from the study average
