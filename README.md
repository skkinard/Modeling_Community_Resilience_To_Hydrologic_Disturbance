#### Summary: 



Spring 2017 surveys indicated compositional shifts in fish and invertebrate  communities coincide with changes in precipitation regime. Precipitation was suspected to act as an abiotic filter via water quality and  disturbance events in mesic and semi-arid streams. Here, we compare  community responses along a precipitation gradient to region-wide  hydrological disturbance events in the form of floods and droughts. We  collected 14 monthly samples of fish communities and local habitat  following Hurricane Harvey to capture post-hurricane responses as well  as responses to seasonal flood and drought events in 9 streams spanning a steep precipitation gradient. We also collected spring and fall samples in 2018 as well as quartely samples in 2020. Here, we analyze these  data in conjunction with flow data from USGS gauges to investigate the  role of precipitation, flow characteristics, and local habitat data to  evaluate the following question. Does aridity act as an environmental  filter to select for communities with adaptation to disturbance?
